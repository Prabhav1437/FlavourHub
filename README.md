## Project Idea

This repository is for my **individual project idea submission** for the S&W graded assignment.  
The idea I’ve selected from the given list is **“Restaurant Website”**.

- A **menu section** with categories like Starters, Main Course, Desserts, and Beverages  
- **Responsive design** that works well on both desktop and mobile  
- A simple **contact section** with location and phone details  
- Elegant colors, fonts, and layout for a premium dining feel  

### Current Status

Development of the website will begin soon, and updates will be pushed before the final submission deadline.
